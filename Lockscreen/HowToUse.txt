Open the "bin" folder and run "Lockscreen.exe" as an Administrator. If you cannot run it as an adminstrator, "run debugapplication.exe"
To quit the application, press "Insert" on your keyboard.
If you are away from your PC, it is best to disable your keyboard (unplug it) temporarily. This application disables alt+tab, but cannot disable the windows key, which will take the application out of fullscreen-exclusive and minimize it.

If the application is not closing, press Ctrl+Alt+Del on your keyboard and terminate the process with Task Manager.

If you have any further questions or issues, please DM 'felpaca' on Discord.
