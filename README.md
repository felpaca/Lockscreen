### Lockscreen - Polar
A lockscreen app. What did you expect?

# This application disables alt+tab when it is opened. Windows will most likely mistake this program for malware, but it is completely safe.
PS: it may require administrator permissions to work properly.

### Not very much to add here, it's a straightforward application and doesn't need a lot of brainpower to use.
